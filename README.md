# go-htmx

Minimalistic go library for htmx

This library contains string constants and documentation for HTTP headers used by htmx.

## Why?

It is already easy to support htmx in a go backend. We only need to add a few
HTTP headers, and we don't need a fancy library for that. This library exists
to provide those headers as documented string constants.
